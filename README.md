# 21 MERN: Book Search Engine

## Description

In this assignment I removed all the api routing and converted to Apollo. 

Added the mutation and query files for importations throughout the rest of the application.

Updated the schemas with typedefs and resolvers. 

Application will deploy locally but I am receiving an error when deploying to heroku. 

The DB is created when the application is started.



Deploy your application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas. Use the [Deploy with Heroku and MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) walkthrough for instructions.
